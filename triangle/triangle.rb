# for it to be a triangle at all:
# a + b â‰¥ c
# b + c â‰¥ a
# a + c â‰¥ b

# An _equilateral_ triangle has all three sides the same length.

# An _isosceles_ triangle has at least two sides the same length.
# (It is sometimes specified as having exactly two sides the same length, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll say at least two.)

# A _scalene_ triangle has all sides of different lengths.
